# 🛡️ ChurnGuard™: Predictive RevOps Intelligence Engine

**Architect:** Alex Rojas Segovia, CEO - Aineurolytics | **Date:** 2025-12-06

## Executive Diagnosis Excerpt
The current reactive customer retention strategy is costing the enterprise client **$12.75M in lost ARR quarterly** due to a Customer Churn Rate of 8.5%. ChurnGuard™ is the **Scientific RevOps Architecture** solution, leveraging an XGBoost core to deliver a proactive, high-fidelity churn risk score ($\hat{y}_{risk}$) directly into operational workflows (Salesforce, HubSpot) to optimize Customer Success resource allocation.

## Strategic ROI
The projected annualized impact includes **$21.6M in ARR Protection** and a **53% reduction in quarterly churn rate**. This shifts the Customer Success paradigm from universal coverage to **risk-prioritized intervention**.

## Architecture Summary
The system is built on a scalable, resilient architecture utilizing a Feature Store, a containerized Python/XGBoost Model Engine, a low-latency FastAPI API serving layer, and orchestrated by a modern MLOps platform (e.g., Kubernetes, Helm, GitHub Actions).

## Getting Started
1.  Ensure Python 3.11+ is installed.
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment.
3.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4.  Run unit tests: `pytest tests/`
5.  Start the API (for local development): `uvicorn src.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
